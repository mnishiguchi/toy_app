## Creating a resource with a scaffold generator program
- Rails scaffolding is generated by passing the scaffold command to the rails generate script.
- The argument of the scaffold command is the singular version of the resource name, together with optional parameters for the data modelâ€™s attributes.

```bash
$ rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

---

## The rake command
- NOTE: In order to ensure that the command uses the version of Rake corresponding to our `Gemfile`, we need to run `rake` using `bundle exec`.
